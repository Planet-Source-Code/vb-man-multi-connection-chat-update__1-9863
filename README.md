### Description

Now there is support for security, forcing all users to log in to the server. The usernames and passwords are stored in a DB at the server site, and the clients are then authenticated. ---> This is a multi connection chat using winsock. It supports multi-user, coloured chat windows, private messages, and will even display all the tasks running on another clients PC (but you'll have to look in the code for the command =). Each client displays the entry and exit of other clients, as well as maintaining a listbox of current users. Also included is a mIRC like entry box where you can use the up and down arrows to access recent commands. Please leave any suggestions.
